NOTICE: This is a dead project for me.  I wrote it a very long time ago when I was new to programming as a project to dip my feet into web dev.  Some day when I have more time I would like to rewrite this so I'm not assamed have my highest stared repo be a messy codebase.  And I'll add a nice way that allows for other chrome plugins to register commands ;)

#CCP Command Palette

Do you love Sublime's Command Palette? Of course you do! CCP Command Palette, or CCP for short, is a chrome extension that allows you to easily accomplish many tasks using only a keyboard.

NOW IN THE [CHROME STORE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-command-palette/cofhcenpbdpcjghambdchdmdlapaiddh)

##How to use CCP Command Palette

1) Open CCP by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P

2) Begin typing.

3) Command Your Browser!

Don't worry about typing everything perfectly. CCP uses fuzzy searching so using only a few characters is often enough to find the command you are looking for.

ie. Say you would like to clear your web cache. Open WebCommand then type "cache" and press enter.
