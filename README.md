Chrome Command Pallete
==========

Chrome Command Pallete, or CCP for short, is a chrome extention that allows you to easily accomplish many tasks using
only a keyboard.  Forget memorizing every shortcut, learn Chrome Command Pallete.


1) Open CCP by pressing <UNDEDIRMINED KEY COMBINATION>

2) Begin typing.

3) Command Your Browser!


Don't worry about typing everything perfectly.  CCP uses fuzzy searching so using only a few characters is often
enough to find the command you are looking for.

ie. Say you would like to clear your web cache.  Press Ctrl+Shift+P to open WebCommand then type "cache" and press enter.
