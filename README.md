##How to use Chrome Command Palette

1) Open CCP by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P

2) Begin typing.

3) Command Your Browser!

Don't worry about typing everything perfectly. CCP uses fuzzy searching so using only a few characters is often enough to find the command you are looking for.

ie. Say you would like to clear your web cache. Open WebCommand then type "cache" and press enter.
