#Chrome Command Pallete

Do you love Sublime's Command Pallete?  Of course you do!
Chrome Command Pallete, or CCP for short, is a chrome extention that allows you to easily accomplish many tasks using
only a keyboard.  Forget memorizing every shortcut, learn Chrome Command Pallete.

##How to use Chrome Command Pallete

1) Open CCP by pressing <UNDEDIRMINED KEY COMBINATION>

2) Begin typing.

3) Command Your Browser!


Don't worry about typing everything perfectly.  CCP uses fuzzy searching so using only a few characters is often
enough to find the command you are looking for.

ie. Say you would like to clear your web cache.  Open WebCommand then type "cache" and press enter.
